# Ethereum Wallet Integration with ReactJS

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate the MetaMask wallet into a ReactJS application for sending Ethereum transactions. It utilizes `ethers.js` and `web3.js` libraries to facilitate blockchain interactions.

## Features

- **MetaMask Wallet Connection**: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to the application.
- **Send Ethereum Transactions**: Facilitates sending Ethereum directly through the user interface.
- **ReactJS Framework**: Built using the latest ReactJS features for a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask Extension installed in your browser

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

**To run the application locally:**
```
npm start
```
This will start the React application on `localhost:3000`.

## Connect to MetaMask

1. Click on the 'Connect to MetaMask' button in the application.
2. A MetaMask prompt will appear asking for permission to connect to your wallet.
3. Once connected, your wallet address and balance will be displayed.
